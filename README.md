# veochart

Data visualization and presentation

## Description

VeoChart is a web application built with ReactJS and TypeScript that visualizes data using graphical
representations, including a radial graph. It provides users with an interactive way to explore and
analyze data.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/margon09/veochart

2. Install the dependencies

`npm install`

2. Start the project:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

#### Considerations

1. Project structure: Project includes components folder, context, hooks and global styles, as well
   as App and package.json.

2. Technologies: used React, TS, styled-components

3. Features: Data visualization (Table, Radar Chart), filters depending on plays (by default all
   selected). In addition to that on smaller screens table data is scrollable, filters are hidden
   and are represented with the filter button that opens the filters.

4. Known issues: Tests are missing. Date range selection is missing.
